# Coding Challenge - BE
A **micro service** providing unique flights coming from two sources.
It is based on **[Micro](https://www.npmjs.com/package/micro)**.

## Installation

```shell script
$ npm install
```
 
## Usage

```shell script
$ npm start
````
Service is now avaliable at **[localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**.


## Testing
We use **[Jest](https://jestjs.io/en/)** for **unit tests**. We also test **code coverage** automatically.

```shell script
$ npm test
```

## Logging
No logging implemented to keep the code simple. 

## Please Note
There's also a script **index_min**, which is ONLY given for demonstration purpose.
It's not something I would use in an enterprise environment.
It's spaghetti code, non-reusable and non-testable.
I only provide it to show that the task can be solved with basically 3 lines of code.
